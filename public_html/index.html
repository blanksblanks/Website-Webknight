        <h3>SPAGHETTI AGLIO E OLIO</h3>
        <h4>Serves however many you are willing to feed</h4>
        
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil water and add salt to make it taste SALTY (approx. 1 tbsp. salt per quart water). Boil spaghetti and keep the water.</li>
                <li>If using chicken, slice to strips and season with chicken stock and cornstarch. If using shrimp, peel and devein. Mince lots of garlic and dry red chili (approx. 2 peppers per person), and prepare crushed black peppercorns. (Protip: buy a food chopper, they make garlic mincing a breeze and costs like $4)</li>
                <li>Add a little bit of olive oil and saute a bit of garlic on low heat. When brown, add chicken or shrimp and cover for 5-7 minutes on medium heat. Dish it out.</li>
                <li>Wipe wok down and add equal oil to garlic. Saute garlic over low fire. When brown, add cooked spaghetti and stir fry on high heat while sprinkling with salty hot water to prevent dryness.</li>
                <li>Add crushed peppercorns and chili to taste. Add cooked chicken or shrimp. And voila!</li>

        <h3>"It's Easy" Paella</h3>
        <h4>Serves a huge party of 15 at least, so adjust ingredients as desired</h4>
        
        <p>Ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb. of long grain rice – Make sure it is LONG GRAIN</li>		
                <li>10 chicken legs</li>                                               
                <li>4 Spanish or Italian sausages</li>						        
                <li>½ lb of ham</li>					
                <li>1 lb of peeled shrimp, squid, crabs (optional)</li>
                <li>1 chopped onion</li>								
                <li>2 chopped red peppers</li>							        
                <li>2 chopped tomatoes</li>						
                <li>4 chopped garlic cloves</li>							    
                <li>½ tsp. of saffron (very expensive)</li>
                <li>1 large can of green peas</li>					            
                <li>2 tbsp. chicken flavored powder (chicken stock)</li>			
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>		
                <li>½ cup of olive oil</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a deep pan cook the chicken in some olive oil until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped vegetables, sliced sausages and fry together until the vegetables are soft.</li>
                <li>Add the rice (measure in cups), saffron, chicken powder, and salt and pepper to taste. For each cup of rice that you added, add 1.5 cups of water. (Tip: buy Goya yellow rice mix and follow its directions if you want to simplify this step)</li>
                <li>Turn the heat to high and as soon as the rice starts boiling, bring the heat to low and cover, let simmer slowly until the water has almost evaporated, stir and push the rice to the middle as if forming a volcano in the middle of the pan, and make sure the rice is not stuck to the pan. Cover again, check constantly to make sure it does not burn, taste for consistency, and if you think it’s not tender enough, add water slowly and keep cooking until it has tenderized to your liking.</li>
                <li>Add the peas and the chopped ham at the last couple of minutes of cooking. En! Buen Provecho!</li>
